Discovering insights in data can be a daunting task. As a beginner, often you don't know where to begin. But an insight does not necessary mean something no one has ever thought about; rather an insight can be something you never thought existed.
You can start with a general question or a statement, then try to see if there are some instances in the data to support it? Most importantly, make use of an effective visualization to reveal the pattern.  

In this simple project, I use the public movielens dataset and explore the variations in the user ratings and attempt to find out if there are some users who give the same rating all the time.


## Analysis
With scatterplot and a simple use of color, the variations in the user ratings were revealed in a form of layers. The initial question, whether or not there are some users assigning the same rating for all movies was answered. Yes, indeed, there are such users in this dataset exhibiting that behavior. Even though not a significant number, it is important to note that the scenario does exist. 

Creating great visualizations does not require advance knowledge of ggplot charting tools. Often a basic one like scatterplot is enough; with a little enhancement with color, one can turn a basic chart into an impressive story point.
